Modes of Operation:
ECB (Electronic Codebook):

Example: Cipher.getInstance("AES/ECB/PKCS5Padding")
Note: ECB is not recommended for encrypting multiple blocks of data because it is not semantically secure.
CBC (Cipher Block Chaining):

Example: Cipher.getInstance("AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding")
Requires an Initialization Vector (IV).
CFB (Cipher Feedback):

Example: Cipher.getInstance("AES/CFB/PKCS5Padding")
Allows data to be processed in smaller segments.
OFB (Output Feedback):

Example: Cipher.getInstance("AES/OFB/PKCS5Padding")
Similar to CFB, processes data in smaller segments.
CTR (Counter):

Example: Cipher.getInstance("AES/CTR/NoPadding")
Converts a block cipher into a stream cipher.
GCM (Galois/Counter Mode):

Example: Cipher.getInstance("AES/GCM/NoPadding")
Provides both confidentiality and authenticity (integrity).
Padding Schemes:
PKCS5Padding: Standard padding scheme for block ciphers.

Example: Cipher.getInstance("AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding")
NoPadding: No padding is applied. The input data must be an exact multiple of the block size.

Example: Cipher.getInstance("AES/CTR/NoPadding")
ISO10126Padding: Another padding scheme that adds random data to the padding bytes.

Example: Cipher.getInstance("AES/CBC/ISO10126Padding")
PKCS7Padding: Similar to PKCS5Padding but used for other block sizes as well.

Example: Cipher.getInstance("AES/CBC/PKCS7Padding")
